%  CLTL BibTex bibliography
%  Please keep this file updated as we will use it to generate our publications 
on cltl.nl
%
%  To keep the file clean, please apply the following housekeeping rules:
%   
%	1. Add an entry of a published paper if you are the first author from the CLTL group 
%	2. Add your project acronym to the keywords field
% 	3. Provide a URL to the PDF source of the paper 
%	   (either somewhere openly published (preferable), or a copy on your own website
%	4. Make sure you don't duplicate keys, so either make up bibkeys that ar
e as specific
%      as possible, or use a bibliography manager to make your life easier   
%   5. If available, add links to "Slides" and "Resources" (For these we have generated 
%      two custom bibtex fields, see below)
%	   
%   For tips and tricks on making a Bibtex bibliography entry see: 
%   http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#BibTeX
%	I can recommend the BibDesk bibliography manager:
%   http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/
%   If you want to make sure you have the "URL" and "Note" fields go to:
%   Preferences -> Fields and make sure 'Url' is selected. 
%   For "Note" you can add a new 'textual' field called "Note"
%   For "Slides" you can add a new 'Remote URL' field called "Slides" 
%   For "Resources" you can add a new 'Remote URL' field called "Resources"
% 
%   On the CLTL Wordpress site, we are using the papercite plugin
%   (https://wordpress.org/plugins/papercite/) 
%   If you have a self hosted Wordpress site, you can also use the CLTL bibfile
%   to generate your own publications list. To do so, add the papercite plugin 
%   to your Wordpress installation (if you are hosting your page on the 
%   let.vupr.nl site it's already there, it may just need to be enabled). 
%   On your publications page, simply state: 
%   [bibtex file=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cltl/bibliography/master/cltl.bib group=year group_order=
desc template=av-bibtex author=YOURLASTNAME] in order to only display your publications
%   Please note that if you have publications from before you joined the group, 
%   you need to specify an additional bibtex source file that contains those 
%   those publications. You can do so within the bibtex command: 
%   [bibtex file=file1,file2 author=YOURLASTNAME] 
%   (don't forget the other display options, check out the papercite documentation 
%   for details)
% 
%   Papercite currently does not support filtering on keywords. For generating a
%   bibliography for your project, you can use bibtool: 
%   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/utils/bibtool/  
%   We are setting up a daily update script for the NewsReader project and will share 
%   this on the RedMine for other projects
%
%   For questions regarding this bibliography file or its use, ask Marieke 
%  
%   To do: modify papercite plugin to also show slides + extra materials link 
%   To do: create auto-update script for project bibliographies
